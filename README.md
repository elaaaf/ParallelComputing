# ParallelComputing
- Parallelization is the execution of the program in multiple CPUs. This is done mainly to improve the performance of a given program. In parallel computing, memory can be shared or distributed. Here, we will only be concerned with shared memory where all cores can read and write the same memory location. We will examine two problems, thread addition and parallel factorial functions, and we will propose a suggested solution for both problems.</br>
- The first file ThreadSum.java makes 1,000 threads each of them adds one to a variable called sum.
- The second file factorial.c compute the factorial for some integer n in parallel.
